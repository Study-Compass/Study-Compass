# **Getting Started with Study Compass**

Welcome to our Study Compass! This document will guide you through setting up and starting our application, which uses React for the frontend and Express for the backend. We utilize Concurrently to run both parts simultaneously, streamlining the development process.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (at least version 12.x)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

You can check your Node.js and npm versions by running **`node -v`** and **`npm -v`** in your terminal.

## **Cloning the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://yourrepositoryurl.com
cd your-project-directory
```

## **Installing Dependencies**

Our project has dependencies for both the frontend and backend. You need to install these separately. Navigate to each directory and install the required packages.

1. **Root Directory Installation**
    
    This will install any utilities and dependencies defined at the project level, such as Concurrently.
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
2. **Frontend Installation**
    
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```
    
3. **Backend Installation**
    
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    npm install
    ```
    

## **Running the Application**

We use Concurrently to run our frontend and backend servers at the same time. You can start both with a single command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command is configured in the root **`package.json`** file and will launch both servers simultaneously. By default, the React application runs on **`localhost:3000`** and the Express server on **`localhost:5001`**.

## **Exploring the Application**

After starting the application, you can access:

- The React frontend at http://localhost:3000
- The Express backend at http://localhost:5001

Feel free to explore the API routes defined in the Express application and interact with the React frontend.

## **Next Steps**

Now that your environment is set up, you're ready to start developing! Here are a few suggestions for next steps:

- Explore the documentation for both the **`frontend`** and **`backend`** directories and components for more detailed information on the specifics of each part of the stack.
- Review the existing components and routes to get a feel for the application structure.
- Begin adding new features or modifying existing ones.
