Term guide:
    First 4 digits represent year, last 2 digits represent term
    01 = Spring
    05 = Summer
    09 = Fall
    Example: 202109 = Fall 2021

How it works:
    1. Get all course ids for a given term using the sis catalog search (refer to get_course_ids())
        Example url: https://sis.rpi.edu/rss/bwckctlg.p_display_courses?term_in=202109&sel_crse_strt=&sel_crse_end=&sel_subj=&sel_levl=&sel_schd=&sel_coll=&sel_divs=&sel_dept=&sel_attr=
        The above url gets all course id's for the term 202109 (Fall 2021), example: ADMN
    2. For each course id, get all active courses (courses that are being taught in the term) using the sis catalog (refer to get_all_courses())
        Example url: https://sis.rpi.edu/rss/bwckctlg.p_display_courses?term_in=202109&call_proc_in=&sel_subj=dummy&sel_levl=dummy&sel_schd=dummy&sel_coll=dummy&sel_divs=dummy&sel_dept=dummy&sel_attr=dummy&sel_subj=ADMN&sel_crse_strt=&sel_crse_end=&sel_title=&sel_levl=%25&sel_schd=%25&sel_coll=%25&sel_divs=%25&sel_dept=%25&sel_from_cred=&sel_to_cred=&sel_attr=%25
        The above url gets all urls for active courses for the term 202109 (Fall 2021) with the course id ADMN, 
        Example result url: https://sis.rpi.edu/rss/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=202109&subj_in=ADMN&crse_in=1824&schd_in=L
        Is able to do this because only active courses have links in their course information, usually next to Schedule Types: 
    3. For each active course, parse all its information (refer to parse_course_info())
        Example url: https://sis.rpi.edu/rss/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=202109&subj_in=ADMN&crse_in=1824&schd_in=L
        We only care about the Scheduled Meeting Times table and the name of the course, inserts information into a dictionary
    9. For each day, append class name, start time, and end time to weekly schedule
    10. For each classroom, insert into database
