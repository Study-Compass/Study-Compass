🎤 Meridian — Final Expanded Transcript (8-Minute Version)
Raven → James → Raven

Slide 1 — Title: “Building Connected Campuses.”
Raven:
 “Hi everyone, I’m Raven Levitt, and this is James Liu — and we’re the co-founders of Meridian, a platform built to connect every layer of campus life.
 Because while higher education has evolved academically and technologically, the student experience itself still feels fragmented — systems don’t talk, communication breaks down, and students feel the gap every day.”

Slide 2 — “The student experience isn’t broken, it’s disconnected.”
Raven:
 “Students and administrators live in separate worlds.
 Students manage clubs, events, and academics across half a dozen apps.
 Administrators track data across separate platforms that rarely overlap.
 No one has a full picture — and it shows up as frustration, miscommunication, and lost engagement.”

Slide 3 — “The Disconnect: What it looks like today.”
Raven:
 “For students, that means juggling outdated portals just to join a club or reserve a study space.
 For administrators, it’s long approval chains, endless spreadsheets, and disconnected workflows that stall progress.
 And somewhere between those two worlds — opportunity is lost.”

Slide 4 — “The Cost: Why it matters.”
Raven:
 “When campuses lack connection, the effects ripple outward.
 Students disengage. Departments duplicate effort.
 And schools can’t act on what students actually need.
National retention rates still hover below 70% — not because schools don’t care, but because they’re managing blindfolded.”

Slide 5 — “The Current Landscape.”
Raven:
 “Right now, every piece of student life runs on its own system: one for events, one for room bookings, one for organizations — none of them speaking the same language.
 Each new tool was meant to solve a problem, but together they’ve created even more fragmentation.

James:
 Meridian changes that — it unites those systems into a single experience.




Slide 6 — “Efficiency · Insight · Connection.”
James:
 At its core, Meridian is built on three principles: connection, efficiency, and insight.
 These aren’t just features — they’re the foundation of how we reimagine student life.
Connection is about breaking silos.
 Right now, information on campus flows like islands — a student organization has no way to talk to the event system, and event data never informs how a building is used.
 Meridian unifies these touchpoints into a single ecosystem, where students, staff, and systems finally speak the same language.
 That connection builds belonging — but it also creates clarity.
Efficiency is what happens next.
 When every department and student group works from the same platform, processes that used to take days — like scheduling, approvals, or coordination — take minutes.
 For students, that means less time wrestling with bureaucracy and more time actually doing what they came to campus for: learning, collaborating, and connecting.
 For administrators, it means less time spent reconciling systems and more time improving the student experience.
And finally, Insight — the real differentiator.
 Once everything runs through a connected system, universities gain visibility they’ve never had before:
 Which events drive the most engagement.
 Which organizations are growing or struggling.
 Which spaces are underutilized or overcrowded.
 That insight turns data into action — letting schools make decisions that actually reflect how students live and learn day-to-day.
Together, these three principles define Meridian’s impact:
 We make campuses more connected, more efficient, and, for the first time, truly data-informed.”

Slide 7 — “Organizations.”
James:
 “Let’s start with organizations — the foundation of student community.
 Most campuses still manage club data manually or through outdated forms. That means no visibility into who’s active, which groups are growing, or how involvement affects student outcomes.
Meridian makes organization life transparent and dynamic.
 Students can easily discover and join communities that fit their interests.
 Leaders can run outreach and track engagement without chasing emails or spreadsheets.
 And administrators can finally see which communities are thriving — and where to invest support.
When you understand involvement, you don’t just track activity — you strengthen belonging and leadership on campus.”

Slide 8 — “Events.”
James:
 “Next are events — the heartbeat of student experience.
 Today, planning an event often means a dozen emails, conflicting calendars, and no clear approval path.
 Meridian replaces that chaos with structure and clarity.
Departments and student organizers can collaborate in one space.
 Approvals route automatically to the right stakeholders — no one gets left out of the loop.
 And on the back end, engagement data and feedback reveal what kinds of events actually bring students together.
So instead of reacting to attendance numbers, schools can proactively design the experiences that make students want to stay.”

Slide 9 — “Spaces.”
James:
 “And finally, spaces — where campus life becomes real.
 From study lounges to classrooms, these are some of a university’s most under-optimized assets.
 Meridian connects students to available spaces in real time while providing administrators with clear visibility into how those spaces are used.
That means fewer conflicts, smarter scheduling, and a better match between how students want to use campus and how it’s actually managed.
 When you understand space utilization, you start designing environments that support focus, collaboration, and community — not just occupancy.”

Slide 10 — “Current Traction.”
Raven:
 “Since launching an early alpha at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Meridian has already proven its value.
Over 8,000 unique visitors in our first year — that’s nearly the entire student body engaging with the platform.


200+ events processed monthly through our system.


500 registered users and over 220 weekly actives — sustained, organic engagement.


Full integration across 157 classrooms, enabling real-time visibility into room usage.


We’re now part of RPI’s active RFP process, positioning us to become an official, campus-wide system — our first institutional partnership.
That level of adoption shows not just need, but pull — students and organizations are seeking out better tools even before their institutions adopt them.”

Slide 11 — “Market.”
Raven:
 “The opportunity ahead is significant.
 The combined K–12 and higher-ed tech market totals $27.9 billion, with higher education alone at $3.6 billion — our immediate focus.
 Our near-term reachable market sits around $75 million, and within that segment, universities are actively replacing outdated infrastructure.
We’re not asking schools to rip out what they have — we integrate with it.
 That makes adoption faster, budgets easier to justify, and our footprint scalable.
Our pricing scales by enrollment size — starting near $25–30K per institution annually, with expansion potential across departments and campuses.

Slide 12 — “The Team.”
Raven:
 “Meridian is built by students who’ve lived the problem — and have the skills to solve it.
I’ve spent the last several years leading initiatives like HackRPI and RCOS, organizing events for hundreds of students and staff — the very kinds of processes Meridian now simplifies.
 James brings deep technical expertise as a full-stack engineer and open-source contributor with professional experience building production-grade systems used by thousands.
Together, we bridge student insight with real engineering execution — one foot in the classroom, one foot in production.”

Slide 13 — “Thank You.”
Raven:
 “Universities talk about connection every day — between people, between ideas, between experiences.
 Meridian makes that connection real.
We’re not just improving campus software; we’re redefining how campuses work together.
Thank you — we’re Meridian, and we’re building connected campuses.”
